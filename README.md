# Pre-work - *The Simon Game*

**The Simon Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Nicholas Palermo**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://simon-says-prework.glitch.me/)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- I did not use any outside sources to help complete my submission, although I hope to read a little more documentation on 
  JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to familiarize myself with the languages prior to any further use.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- There were not really any challenges I faced while creating this submission, in terms of programming and code. However, the function used to 
  create the sounds did create a bit of an issue. While writing the code, even as written in the walkthrough videos, no sounds were being produced
  while running the program. At first I assumed there was an issue with the code I had written, so I double checked my code with the instructional
  code offered in the video, and then ran it again. Still, there were no sounds. I assumed maybe the sounds were not being produced on my speakers,
  so I attached secondary speakers, and even played other sounds and still nothing. I reassessed my code, and then finally thought maybe it could have
  been my browser interacting with Glitch's IDE. I finally switched from Safari – which I knew ahead of time could cause issues with certain websites – to 
  Google Chrome. That fixed the issue, thankfully, and I was able to finally toy with the pitches, especially when creating the extra two game buttons I had implemented.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- My biggest question question regarding web development after completing this is actually a question I had prior to beginning this submission. I am really interested in 
how websites interact with one another, and more importantly how they store user information. I am actually involved in a CodePath iOS course, and we have just had out first
experience with Parse Databases, and I am wondering if that process is similar for web development. I am also curious as to what additionaly functions are built into JavaScript
and CSS that aid in both developing websites and UI's for those web pages. Additionally, I would like to learn more about other languages and technologies used within Web development.
I know there was a list of technologies that would be studied in this internship, and I look forward to the opportunity in becoming more familiar with these technologies/languages.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitly implement additonal features. I would have loved to create a losing featuring, making the game more difficult and aimed at a goal.
  I would have also liked to create an unlimited pattern or at least a large enough number to make it harder, and implement an on-screen counter to count what round the player has reached. And most importantly,
  I wish I had the time randomize the pattern so it cannot be remebered, increasing the difficulty, and also offering variety to the game. And lastly, I would like to toy with the sounds enough to create a tune
  to the pattern of the sounds, that is more and more recognizable as you get to the higher rounds.
